# Changelog

All notable Neural Labs changes are recorded here. Releases use Semantic
Versioning and Git tags in the form `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

## [Unreleased]

### Development workflow

- Added required CI, protected development/release branches, weekly release
  procedures, and a manually dispatched, validated draft-release workflow.
- Updated the phone-verification browser fixture for Security and kept the
  mobile Latest control clear of attachment action buttons on short screens.

### Changed

- Added a global Twilio SMS/MMS plugin with encrypted administrator-managed
  credentials, read-only connection and webhook checks, in-product Twilio
  Console setup steps, and the official pinned OpenClaw SMS channel.
- Verified workspace phone numbers now form the inbound SMS allowlist and route
  to each member's private Neura. Proactive agent SMS/MMS requires a per-member
  opt-in and the agent tool accepts only workspace identities.

- Added a personal Model Provider page, account-aware model/reasoning pickers,
  versioned follow-latest/pinned defaults, and independent Background AI,
  dedicated Team Neura and Voice settings. Team activation is administrator
  confirmed; queued runs preserve accepted settings. Claude subscriptions remain
  explicitly release-gated. Workspace status distinguishes credentials from
  runtime/model readiness. Automations preserve reasoning `off` and strict pins.

- Neura private and Team Chat composers now use Enter to send and Shift+Enter
  for a new line on every viewport. During an active private run Enter steers,
  while queueing remains an explicit Send options action. Enter also accepts
  the highlighted `@` mention or `$` skill suggestion.
- Team Chat now completes `@Neura` and current channel-member `@handle` tags in
  a searchable composer popup. Neura is summoned only through `@Neura`; the
  misspelled `$nerua` and legacy `$neura` aliases no longer invoke the agent.
- Team Chat voice memos are now always hold-to-talk with no mode toggle. Private
  voice keeps a dedicated Open/Hold switch for continuous or press-to-transmit
  microphone behavior.

- Fresh desktops start empty instead of automatically opening Terminal. Returning
  sessions continue to restore their saved open and minimized windows.

- Neura's phone layout now has searchable, collapsible conversation history,
  visible chat actions, a channel-terminal drawer, and a growing touch-friendly
  composer. Terminal adds named session navigation, mobile split-pane tabs,
  keyboard/Ctrl/Esc/Tab/arrow controls, and clipboard permission feedback. Both
  apps reserve space for the soft keyboard and floating dock.

- Files now uses one Explorer-style directory view with tabs, navigation history,
  personal synced sidebar pins, Recent, recursive filename search, multi-select,
  copy/move/rename, folder uploads, ZIP downloads, and a recoverable shared Trash
  with 90-day retention. File operations expose progress, cancellation, retry,
  and explicit conflict handling; replacements preserve the old item in Trash.
- A self-hosted, sandboxed miniPaint Image Editor opens workspace images and saves
  layered `.minipaint.json` projects or flattened PNG/JPEG/WebP through the
  authenticated Files API with stale-write protection.
- Neura now has a durable OpenClaw-managed Chromium browser for QA. The
  workspace image includes browser fonts and Chromium, and private and Team
  agents receive OpenClaw's browser snapshots, screenshots, and interaction
  tool through the isolated `openclaw` profile.
- Neura's website toolchain now includes FFmpeg/FFprobe, WebP and ImageMagick
  image utilities, and a working rsync installation. Team website skills make
  omitted creative choices automatically, require complete showcase builds to
  include a viewport-scale scroll-video or frame-sequence scene when compatible
  media is available, and prepare seek-friendly local video instead of falling
  back to a pointer reveal for convenience.
- Isolated Team Neura runs may now use up to 30 minutes, allowing supervised
  website research, media preparation, browser QA, and deployment to finish as
  one bounded run instead of being cut off by the former 10-minute ceiling.
- Neura now streams only the final answer in the main transcript while signed
  commentary, safe thinking status, plans, tools, commands, outputs, and file
  patches stay in the collapsed **Work details** below it. Expanded file steps
  show a bounded, credential-redacted patch for code review.
- Neura private chats now have a wave control for a five-minute, live WebRTC
  voice conversation. Team Chat's wave control records a voice memo, stores a
  playable workspace attachment, transcribes it, and sends the transcript as
  an `@Neura` turn so the agent receives the spoken context.
- Neura opens on its new-chat screen when the newest conversation has been idle
  for at least three hours. Returning again without new activity does not keep
  resetting the user's selection, and an active run is always preserved.
- VS Code replaces the standalone Editor in the desktop dock and Files workflow.
  New files and text/code files open in the existing code-server window, every
  file has an **Open in VS Code** action, and folder context menus can open the
  selected directory in VS Code. Previously saved Editor windows migrate to VS
  Code when desktop state is restored.
- Team Chat now uses `@Neura` for general agent turns while retaining `$skill-name`
  commands. Personal and Team Chat render image attachments inline and other
  files as download cards; Team Neura can attach generated workspace artifacts.
- Neura-generated static-site links now open the desktop Preview app. Website
  previews use short-lived, user-bound launch capabilities instead of reusable
  folder-encoded URLs, and the sandbox no longer permits remote assets or popups.

- Settings now presents agent extensions as **Plugins**, available to every
  active member and divided into private, user-owned plugins and global,
  administrator-managed workspace plugins. The former MCP screen is a locked
  global **Neural Labs Tools** system plugin with its live health and tool
  inventory intact.
- The add-plugin experience previews connection-only MCP plugins, including
  scope selection, authentication, discovery, and permission review, without
  accepting server URLs or credentials before the secure broker is built.
- Team Terminal input is now live for every connected participant. The former
  driver handoff, spectator mode, and **Take control** action have been removed;
  concurrent keystrokes reach the shared PTY in server arrival order.
- PTY resizing remains stable through an invisible layout leader that transfers
  automatically when its browser disconnects.
- Team Terminal WebRTC voice now prefers direct media and falls back to a
  self-hosted coturn relay over UDP or TCP.

### Security and operations

- Browser automation remains headless inside the workspace container, never
  attaches to a developer's personal browser profile, and retains OpenClaw's
  private-network SSRF denial except for exact `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
  grants needed to verify workspace-local preview servers.
- Voice provider credentials remain server-side. The new voice routes require
  an authenticated same-origin request, constrain SDP and audio sizes, and use
  a pseudonymous safety identifier; deployment must provide `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- The VS Code open handoff accepts only authenticated, same-origin POSTs and
  resolves existing nonsymlink workspace paths before navigating the requesting
  developer's own embedded workbench. It cannot address paths outside the
  shared workspace and adds no listener or host mount.
- TURN uses authenticated one-hour HMAC credentials with pseudonymous user
  keys. The relay has allocation and bandwidth quotas, a narrow UDP range, no
  administrative CLI or database, and cannot relay to private, loopback,
  carrier-NAT, link-local, or multicast destinations.
- Deployment now requires public TCP/UDP forwarding for the TURN listener and
  UDP forwarding for the configured relay range. No database migration is
  required.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Newly registered passkeys now appear immediately in Personalization and are
  reconciled against the authoritative no-cache account list without requiring
  a page refresh.
- Passkey creation and removal broadcast a browser-local account change so
  every open Personalization view in the current desktop refreshes together.
- Passkey rows now show the localized creation date and time. After the first
  credential is registered, the enrollment form clearly changes to **Add
  another passkey**.
- Neura now presents an animated, centered readiness state while a new private
  conversation is created, subscribed over the live Gateway connection, and
  reconciled with its recent history.
- Explicit assistant commentary is now grouped with plans, commands, tools,
  and file activity inside the collapsed **Work details** timeline. Only the
  terminal answer remains as ordinary assistant text in the chat.

### Fixed

- Fixed successful passkey enrollment leaving the UI on **My passkey** and
  **Create passkey** until Settings or the browser was manually refreshed.
- Preserved the successful registration response optimistically if the
  follow-up list request fails, while later successful synchronization remains
  authoritative.
- Removed the synthetic **starting model / Neura is working through the
  request / Done** step produced by routine Gateway status frames. Status still
  drives the live run and queue controls without being presented as work.
- Fixed durable commentary appearing as separate assistant chat bubbles after
  a live event or history reload. Legacy unphased pre-tool updates are folded
  once later same-turn activity proves they were not the terminal answer.
- Fixed refreshes during an active run mistaking the latest durable progress
  update for the final answer. The unfinished tail now stays in collapsed Work
  details, and unphased live stream commits follow the same rule.

### Security and operations

- The synchronization carries only the existing public passkey metadata. It
  does not expose WebAuthn private keys, credential material, challenges, or
  transaction tokens and adds no network listener or trust-boundary change.
- Neura's progress projection uses OpenClaw's explicit `commentary` phase and
  same-turn supersession; raw model reasoning remains excluded and
  credential-shaped command output remains redacted.
- Rebuild and recreate the workspace service to deploy the updated desktop.
  No database migration is required.
- Implementation, test, upgrade, rollback, and security details are recorded in
  [the v0.3.2 release record](wiki/releases/v0.3.2.md).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- Renamed the canonical Skills desktop window to **Skills & Automations** so
  its title reflects both dock entry points and the combined workflow surface.
- The desktop now provisions and verifies the signed-in user's personal agent
  through the authenticated account endpoint before starting the shared Neura
  Gateway client. Transient bootstrap failures retry when the page is visible,
  online, or the retry timer expires.
- A disconnected or paused personal account now produces a long-lived, actionable
  desktop toast. Selecting it opens or focuses Settings directly on
  Personalization, including for administrators whose Settings window was
  previously showing another section.

### Fixed

- Fixed personal agent provisioning failing on OpenClaw 2026.8.2 because the
  configuration command used the unsupported `--json-strict` option. Neural
  Labs now uses OpenClaw's supported `--strict-json` option.
- Fixed `unknown agent id` races by waiting until the live Gateway reports the
  provisioned personal agent before returning account bootstrap state.
- Fixed first-time ChatGPT connection requiring a Gateway browser profile to
  exist before the device-code flow could start. Role assignment now happens
  immediately for an existing authenticated account or after successful login;
  unauthenticated users can request their first device code without circular
  setup steps.
- Removed the Neura client's implicit `main` agent default. Socket startup and
  agent-scoped requests now fail closed until the verified personal agent ID is
  available, so interactive work cannot race onto the workspace automation
  identity.

### Security and operations

- No credential, device code, provider token, tenant state, host address, or
  new public listener is introduced. The browser still receives only safe
  personal-account status and its own stable non-secret agent ID.
- The existing exact per-user agent allowlist, `sessions.others = none`,
  loopback Gateway administration, and no-fallback automation boundary remain
  unchanged.
- Rebuild and recreate the workspace container after upgrading. Existing
  personal OAuth state, shared files, skill drafts, terminals' persistent
  metadata, and code-server data remain in their existing volumes.
- Diagnosis, compatibility notes, validation coverage, upgrade steps, and
  rollback guidance are recorded in
  [the v0.3.1 release record](wiki/releases/v0.3.1.md).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Added Microsoft-bootstrapped passkey enrollment in Personalization and
  discoverable, user-verifying passkey login for existing approved accounts.
- Added a full-window graphical Skill Builder with synchronized metadata and
  canonical source views for `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, references,
  scripts, assets, invocation policy, icons, and MCP dependencies.
- Added durable server-side drafts with Yjs character-level collaboration,
  presence, owner-selected collaborators, administrator oversight, validation,
  explicit publication, and shared unpublished Neura tests.
- Added a graphical automation draft flow, including a first-class **Run a
  skill** action that emits the canonical `$skill-name` invocation.
- Added a Personalization card where every user connects, monitors, pauses, and
  resumes their own ChatGPT device-code session for interactive Neura.
- Added one isolated OpenClaw agent/auth directory and one exact Gateway agent
  role per Neural Labs user, provisioned from the immutable user ID.
- Added durable, redacted Team Chat work timelines for plans, commands, file
  operations, tool actions, and results.

### Changed

- Refreshed the sign-in, signup, pending-access, setup, and administrator
  surfaces with one responsive light paper-and-spectrum account experience.
- Skills is now the canonical reusable-workflow app. The Automations dock icon
  focuses its Automations section rather than opening a second app instance.
- Regular users can inspect redacted operational automation state and history;
  unredacted configuration and all scheduler mutations remain administrator-only.
- Skill shortcuts now use one lowercase, hyphenated `$skill-name` form, and a
  published slug is immutable.
- Skill details now fetch and render the live OpenClaw `SKILL.md` instruction
  body in a bounded document viewer. Installed OpenClaw skills have a dedicated
  detail pane, and automation prompts use the same scrollable Markdown treatment.
- Private Neura now uses the signed-in user's personal OpenClaw agent instead of
  the shared `main` agent. Missing or paused personal auth fails closed.
- Team Chat `$Neura` turns use the message author's personal OpenAI account and
  receive prior shared work details alongside the bounded channel transcript.
- The workspace `main` OpenAI connection is now explicitly reserved for
  automations, heartbeats, and other background/system work.

### Fixed

- Fixed desktop restoration forcing Terminal open even when the browser's saved
  per-user window state had Terminal closed or minimized.
- Fixed installed Skills remaining on “Loading” because the UI requested
  OpenClaw's optional `skill-card.md` instead of the actual `SKILL.md`. Static
  instructions now use an authenticated, allowlisted read while live skill
  status continues over the Gateway WebSocket.
- Fixed interactive Neura usage being attributed to the administrator's shared
  workspace OpenAI account.
- Fixed periodic personal-access reconciliation reapplying the `unlinked` role
  and disconnecting an already restricted Neura browser every 30 seconds.

### Security

- Passkey ceremonies bind to the configured public origin and hostname, consume
  five-minute challenges once, require authenticator user verification, rate
  limit anonymous attempts, and store public credential material only.
- Builder HTTP and WebSocket operations derive identity from authenticated
  ingress, require the configured origin for mutations, authorize each draft,
  constrain package paths and sizes, and reject common credential shapes.
- The builder adds no public port and does not widen the ordinary Neura
  Gateway scopes.
- Personal OAuth tokens stay in per-agent OpenClaw auth storage and are never
  returned to the browser or stored in PostgreSQL. The default Gateway role has
  an empty agent allowlist, and personal roles allow exactly one agent with no
  access to other users' sessions.
- A runtime-generated, rotating Gateway password is limited to the Gateway and
  workspace loopback role-management client, is not persisted in configuration
  or inherited by agent runs, and adds no new listener or host port.
- Team Chat activity persistence applies size limits, credential-pattern
  redaction, and generic reasoning labels rather than exposing raw reasoning.
- Team Chat passes its bounded transcript through a private, short-lived file
  instead of exposing it in process arguments; trusted-proxy loopback identity
  spoofing remains disabled.

### Operations and compatibility

- Database migration 5 adds a bounded JSON activity projection to Team Chat
  agent-run records; it adds no credential column or table.
- Database migration 6 adds passkey public-key metadata and expiring one-time
  ceremony challenges; authenticator private keys remain on user devices.
- The first upgraded workspace start removes legacy `main`-agent
  `neura-private` sessions. This development migration is intentionally not
  reversible from application state; restore a pre-upgrade volume backup if
  that history is required.
- Rebuild and recreate the control-plane and workspace containers after
  upgrading. Existing workspace files, system automation auth, personal OpenAI
  auth, skill drafts, and code-server data remain in their persistent volumes.
- Full design, trust-boundary, validation, upgrade, and rollback details are in
  [the v0.3.0 release record](wiki/releases/v0.3.0.md).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-02

### Highlights

- Reworked Terminal into a social coding surface that opens on a focused
  **New Terminal** launch page with discoverable Team sessions.
- Added authenticated, same-origin VS Code as a first-class desktop app backed
  by the shared workspace filesystem.
- Added pop-out and pop-in controls to every integrated desktop app window.
  Live app surfaces move between the desktop and a separate browser window
  without creating a duplicate app instance.
- Made Neura steering reliable during active work and added a visible FIFO
  follow-up queue that advances automatically after each run.

### Added

- A scrollable Team session rail with compact session icons, live connection
  state, participant badges on hover or keyboard focus, and controller status.
- An inline **+ Team** flow for naming and starting a collaborative terminal;
  the previous team-selection dropdown is no longer part of the launch flow.
- Resume actions for recent personal terminals and join actions for running
  Team terminals.
- A VS Code dock icon, desktop window, load status, reload action, and an
  optional open-in-tab action.
- A managed local code-server child process with readiness reporting and
  persistent user settings and extensions.
- A same-origin authenticated HTTP and WebSocket proxy for the embedded VS Code
  surface.
- Per-window **Pop out** and **Pop back into desktop** controls for Neura,
  Files, Editor, Preview, VS Code, Terminal, Automations, Skills, and Settings.
- Dock actions to focus an external app window or bring one or more pop-outs
  back into the desktop.
- Automatic recovery when a pop-out is closed with browser chrome, plus clear
  guidance when a browser blocks the requested window.
- A compact Neura run-state banner and scrollable queued-message panel with
  queue positions, attachment counts, and per-message removal.
- Compact, expandable Neura work timelines for thinking status, plans,
  commands, file operations, tool actions, command output, and durable history.
- A **Copy path** action for Files context menus that copies the selected file
  or folder's `~/workspace/...` path and reports clipboard permission failures.

### Changed

- Terminal is the active app on desktop startup. The terminal emulator is
  created only after the user starts, resumes, or joins a session.
- Terminal launch controls, text scaling, empty states, and responsive layouts
  were simplified to keep the coding surface primary.
- Minimized Neura, Terminal, and VS Code surfaces remain mounted to preserve
  their live browser-side state.
- Desktop window titles now reserve space for four controls and truncate long
  preview titles cleanly.
- Neura now treats Enter as immediate steering for the complete lifetime of an
  active run. Ctrl/Cmd+Enter admits a Gateway-owned follow-up instead of relying
  on a browser-side timer.
- Neura keeps its transcript mounted during Gateway reconnects and reconciles
  durable history without replacing stable message nodes.

### Fixed

- Fixed the Terminal status and text-size row expanding into the content area
  and covering the terminal when no emulator was mounted.
- Fixed startup behavior that could restore an unrelated app above Terminal.
- Fixed small-screen window-control targeting so adding the pop-out action does
  not hide the close control.
- Fixed persisted assistant updates and follow-up admission acknowledgements
  incorrectly marking Neura idle while the original agent run was still active.
- Fixed sessions that were already running when Neura opened not exposing the
  steer, queue, and stop controls until another streaming event arrived.
- Fixed Neura clearing and rebuilding its transcript during a Gateway WebSocket
  reconnect, which could reset the reader to the top of a long chat.
- Fixed transcript updates either stealing the reader's position or failing to
  follow new messages. Bottom-follow now pauses after an intentional upward
  scroll and resumes through a visible **Latest** action.
- Fixed dock clicks minimizing an app that was open behind another window.
  Clicking a background app now raises its most recent window; clicking the
  already-frontmost app still minimizes it.

### Security

- code-server listens only inside the workspace container and is not published
  as a host port.
- VS Code requests continue through existing authenticated workspace ingress.
  The proxy requires trusted identity, enforces same-origin mutation and
  WebSocket requests, and strips inbound credential and identity headers before
  forwarding.
- Embedded VS Code framing is limited to the same origin. The broader desktop
  remains non-embeddable.
- Pop-outs use a blank same-origin browser document and never place app state,
  credentials, or session material in a URL.
- Downloaded code-server archives are verified against architecture-specific
  checksums during the image build.

### Operations and compatibility

- No database migration is required.
- Existing per-device desktop state remains compatible. A pop-out is restored
  as an ordinary desktop window after a desktop reload.
- Deploying this release requires rebuilding and recreating the workspace
  container. Persistent files, settings, extensions, and server-side terminal
  metadata remain in their existing volumes; running terminal processes end
  during container replacement.
- Full release details, validation evidence, upgrade notes, and rollback steps
  are in [the v0.2.0 release record](wiki/releases/v0.2.0.md).
