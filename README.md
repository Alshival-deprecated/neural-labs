# Neural Labs

Neural Labs is an open-source, self-hosted control plane and shared developer
workspace. This repository contains:

Current release: **v0.3.2**. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) and
[detailed release record](wiki/releases/v0.3.2.md).

Planned UI and documentation work: [Neura roadmap tracker](tracker.md).

- `web/`: the public landing page;
- `console/`: the React account, login, signup, and approval interface;
- `control-plane/`: onboarding, session security, authorization, and console
  APIs;
- `mcp/`: the workspace-local provider MCP plus a retained,
  disabled implementation of the future Microsoft Entra-protected public server;
- `workspace/`: the shared desktop plus the pinned OpenClaw and Codex developer
  runtime, including the Neura agent and persistent Files apps;
- `deploy/`: loopback-only Compose and host Nginx configuration;
- `wiki/`: setup, operations, security decisions, and recovery runbooks.

Start with the [container deployment guide](wiki/container-deployment.md), then
follow the [manual Entra app setup](wiki/entra-app-setup.md) if Microsoft sign-in
is required. V1 provider tools run only inside the trusted shared workspace;
public MCP ingress is deliberately disabled.

```bash
bin/neural-labs init
# Edit the single root .env, including NEURAL_LABS_INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL.
bin/neural-labs up
```

Use `bin/neural-labs help` for status, logs, health checks, safe updates,
backups, and shutdown. Compose remains the deployment source of truth.

Approved users share one persistent, always-on workspace. After the stack is
started, an administrator opens the dock's **Settings** app and connects the
workspace service account from its Workspace section for automations and
background work. Each teammate connects their own ChatGPT account from
Personalization for private Neura and the Team Chat turns they author; see the
[workspace guide](wiki/shared-workspace.md). The
[administrator settings guide](wiki/desktop-settings.md) covers access,
authentication, MCP, and audit controls. The [passkey guide](wiki/passkeys.md)
covers Microsoft-bootstrapped enrollment, passwordless login, credential
removal, and hostname requirements.
The [workspace provider MCP guide](wiki/workspace-provider-mcp.md) documents
Google Places, Geocoding, KLIPY, and Pexels tools available to the shared agent.
The [Files guide](wiki/files.md) documents browser uploads, folder management,
downloads, deletion, and the shared-filesystem boundary. The
[VS Code guide](wiki/vscode.md) covers the default source editor and Files
handoff; the [retired Editor note](wiki/editor.md) documents the transition.
The [Automations guide](wiki/automations.md) covers shared operational status,
administrator-only scheduler mutation, and the dedicated trusted-proxy boundary.
The [Skills guide](wiki/skills.md) covers the graphical collaborative builder,
direct personal and team skills, automation drafts, Neura testing, and
OpenClaw/ClawHub discovery.

Never place tenant credentials, certificates, deployment secrets, or database
backups in the repository.

Development follows the [branch and release workflow](wiki/release-workflow.md).
